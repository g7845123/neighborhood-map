This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I should exploit [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/) and other third-party APIs to implement a neighborhood map application usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. 

I first explore [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and  add a full-screen map with a search bar to my page. I then use [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to search popular neighbor places around user identified place and add clickable map markers to these places. Additional information such as Foursquare rating is also available in an interactive list view of neighbor places.

Click [this link](http://g7845123.github.io/neighborhood-map) for a online demo of this application. 

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.md".
